# AI Photo Editing Backend API

## Project Overview
Flask-based REST API for AI-powered photo editing features including face swap, image upscaling, old photo restoration, cartoonify effects, and style transfer. Built to integrate with Flutter mobile apps.

## Purpose
Provide serverless AI image processing capabilities using Hugging Face Inference API models for a mobile app similar to Glam AI, with features like:
- Face swapping
- HD image upscaling (Real-ESRGAN)
- Old photo restoration (GFPGAN)
- Cartoonify and style transfer
- Template-based transformations (Ghostface, Fashion, Graduate, etc.)
- Future baby prediction
- AI hugs generation
- Professional headshots

## Current State
✅ Flask API server running on port 5000
✅ **Replicate API integration (primary)** with Hugging Face fallback
✅ **Supabase Storage integration** - Persistent image storage fully functional
✅ All features fully working: HD upscale, restore, face swap, cartoonify, style transfer
✅ Advanced endpoints: background removal, depth map, AI hugs, future baby, templates
✅ Automatic fallback logic for maximum reliability
✅ CORS enabled for cross-origin requests
✅ Comprehensive API documentation updated for Replicate
✅ Production-ready with robust error handling
✅ **Web Testing UI** - Beautiful interface to test all API features
✅ **Flutter Integration Guide** - Complete Flutter code examples and documentation

## Integration Notes

### For Flutter App
1. Use multipart/form-data for image uploads
2. All endpoints return PNG image data on success
3. Error responses are JSON with `error` and `details` fields
4. Processing time: 5-30 seconds depending on model
5. See `API_INTEGRATION.md` for Flutter code examples

### Alternative Services
- **Replicate API**: ✅ Integrated as primary provider
- **Hugging Face API**: ✅ Integrated as fallback provider
- **Supabase Storage**: ✅ Fully integrated for permanent image storage
  - Bucket: `ai-photos` (public read access)
  - Automatic URL generation for stored images
  - User-organized file structure: `user-id/feature_timestamp_uuid.png`

## Development Commands
- Run server: `python app.py`
- Test endpoints: `python test_api.py`
- Port: 5000 (webview enabled)

## Next Steps (Future Phase)
- ✅ Supabase Storage integration (COMPLETE)
- ✅ Flutter integration documentation (COMPLETE)
- ✅ Deploy with production WSGI server (COMPLETE - Gunicorn)
- ✅ Flutter app with all features (COMPLETE)
- Add user authentication (Supabase Auth)
- Implement rate limiting
- Create payment integration for premium features
- Add job queue for batch processing
- Optimize model selection based on performance
- Add image caching layer
- Add image gallery/history feature

## Notes
- Server runs in debug mode for development
- All requests require valid Hugging Face API token
- CORS enabled for all origins (configure for production)
- Images processed in memory, no local storage currently
- Models load on-demand via Hugging Face Inference API
